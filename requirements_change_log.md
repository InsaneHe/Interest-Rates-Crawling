## 1. We found that the version of pytz should be 2024.2 instead of 024.2.

## 2. We found that we should just install the PySimpleGUI==5.0.8.3 if you are using a higher version python.

## 3. We should just install all of the packages according to the requirements.txt instead of installing the packages we need by ourselves.
